# posture-detection-
checks for bad posture 


uses mediapipe model for pose estimation and detection 

# working 

prameters for checking the posture 
the programs picks up the landmarks detected from the model and draws tangent from them 

if slope is not in the desired range --> wrong posture 

if posture is in the desired range --> corrct posture
